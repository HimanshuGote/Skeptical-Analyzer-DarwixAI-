# Skeptical News Article Analyzer üì∞

A Python program that provides a critical, skeptical analysis of online news articles. It fetches the article's content and leverages a Generative AI model from Groq to produce a structured report that helps users evaluate the article's objectivity and trustworthiness.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Dynamic Input:** Analyze content from either a live URL or a local file path.
* **Intelligent Web Scraping:** Uses **`requests`** and **`BeautifulSoup4`** to intelligently fetch and parse HTML content, extracting only the essential title and body text.
* **Robust AI Analysis:** Integrates with the **Groq API** to perform a multi-point analysis, covering core claims, language tone, potential red flags, and verification questions.
* **Structured Output:** Generates a clean, readable report in Markdown format (`critical_analysis_report.md`).
* **Secure API Key Management:** Follows best practices by using environment variables to store the sensitive Groq API key.

## üìÅ Project Structure

This project is organized for clarity and ease of use. Below is a simplified representation of the directory structure.

skeptical-analyzer/

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skeptical_analyzer.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md


* `skeptical_analyzer.py`: The main script that contains all the application logic.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of all necessary Python libraries for the project.
* `README.md`: The project's documentation and user guide (this file).
* `critical_analysis_report.md`: The output file generated by the script, containing the final report.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* A Groq API key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/skeptical-analyzer.git](https://github.com/your-username/skeptical-analyzer.git)
    cd skeptical-analyzer
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Set the Groq API Key

Before running the script, you must set your API key as an environment variable.

* **On Windows (in Command Prompt):**
    ```bash
    set GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    ```
* **On macOS/Linux (in Terminal):**
    ```bash
    export GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    ```
    > **Note:** For a permanent setup, add the `export` command to your shell's profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

## üíª How It Works: A Detailed Workflow

The program executes a systematic pipeline to analyze the article. 

1.  **Input & Fetching:** The script accepts a command-line argument that can be either a URL or a local file path. If it's a URL, the **`requests`** library fetches the HTML content, mimicking a web browser.
2.  **Web Scraping:** The raw HTML is passed to **`BeautifulSoup4`**, which parses it to extract the clean article title and body text, stripping out ads, navigation menus, and other irrelevant content.
3.  **AI Analysis:** The cleaned text is sent to the **Groq API**. The script uses a series of tailored prompts to instruct the AI model to perform a multi-point analysis, looking for specific elements like:
    * **Core Claims:** The main factual statements.
    * **Language & Tone:** Biased, emotional, or sensational language.
    * **Potential Red Flags:** Signs of poor journalism (e.g., lack of cited sources, anecdotal evidence).
    * **Verification Questions:** Critical questions for the reader to perform their own research.
4.  **Report Generation:** The analysis results are formatted into a structured Markdown document, providing a clear, sectioned report saved as `critical_analysis_report.md`.

## üèÉ Usage
Run the script from the command line, providing a URL as an argument.
```bash
python skeptical_analyzer.py "[https://example-news-article.com/article-url](https://example-news-article.com/article-url)"
```
Replace the URL with the link to the news article you want to analyze. The program will generate a file named critical_analysis_report.md in the same directory. This file contains the complete report in Markdown format.
